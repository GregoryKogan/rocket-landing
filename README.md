# RocketLanding-AI

This is program that teaches rockets to land on platform in front of your eyes.

As most of my other AI projects, it uses my neural network library for learning.
It teaches network with not very complicated genetic algorithm. It also uses batch learning,
because for effective learning population should contain at least few hundred of rockets, but average
computer can't handle that amount of rockets at once.

In regular mode rockets are fully new and untrained. They are learning in front of you. But if you don't want
to wait and just interested in final result, you can press 'Run pretrained model' buton. 
This will take you demonstration mode. I trained rockets for 6000+ generations and you can watch nearly perfect
perfomance of one of them.

On mobile devices only demostration mode is available, because of lack of computing power for learning mode.
